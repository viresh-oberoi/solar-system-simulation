# solar-system-simulation

This repository holds the code for a Solar System Simulation I created to highlight the relationship between Stars and Planets. This was developed using Java, applying the principles of a Model-View-Control design pattern. The Planet and Star classes act as the model, the SolarSystemAnimation as the view, and SolarSystem as the control.
